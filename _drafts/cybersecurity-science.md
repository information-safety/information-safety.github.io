Draw upon 2014 Hollnagel article:

Hollnagel, E. (2014). Is safety a subject for science? Safety Science, 67, 21-24. <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssci.2013.07.025>

Like Safety, Security is "defined as a condition where nothing goes wrong ... or more cautiously as a condition where the number of things that go wrong is acceptably small." That is to say, success in security is measured by the absence of breaches or incidents. This means that when we are insecure, we have something to measure (vulnerabilities, incidents, breaches), but when we are secure, we have nothing to measure.

This is an indirect definition of security.

Scope cybersecurity as defending against malicious attackers; while accidental data spillage can and does lead to breaches, accidents are better handled by safety.

Use Monte Carlo to show how even large reductions in breach frequency/likelihood (Poisson) can't be detected within a single organization.

How can we know what works?

1. Aggregating data on control effectiveness across many organizations
1. Studying *actual* attacker behavior (not imagined behavior)
1. Observing how attacks are successfully stopped

(Extrapolate and hypothesize from all)

For #2, we can extrapolate based on attacker point of view; for example, the lazy attacker hypothesis. We can also consider risk from the attacker's perspective - an argument against attackers physically attacking their target.
