Original article, showcasing the phishing training challenge: <https://medium.com/people-security/a-shocking-paradox-does-security-awareness-training-increase-human-cyber-risk-27dab191c5dc>

What does the academy say? Literature review on phishing training: <https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13673-020-00237-7>

What does the data say? Elevate and Cyentia research.

First report, <https://elevatesecurity.com/resource/cyentia-elevating-human-attack-surface-management/>

Key findings:

- Completing training 1-3 times reduces average click rates, performance degrades after that
- More simulation emails decrease average click rate, but click rates flatten out just below 5%
- "100.0% of orgs eventually click or are compromised" (someone within the org *always* clicks)
- "100.0% of orgs download or execute malware"

Second report, <https://elevatesecurity.com/resource/the-size-and-shape-of-workforce-risk/>

Key findings:

> - Some users get many more phishing emails than others (100s per year vs. a few).
> - The more emails a department gets the better they are at blocking them.
> - Most users wonâ€™t click the emails that do make it to their inboxes.
> - But some of those who do will click a lot (as much as one click per week).
> - Subjecting all users to the same level/type of treatment is counterproductive.

Nearly 80% of users never click, and 4% account for 80% of clicks. In other words, a small number of high-risk users are the biggest source of phishing clicks. Recommends identifying and *helping* the high-risk users. (Marcus Ranum story about the department whose job was opening email attachments)

(A third report, <https://go.elevatesecurity.com/high-risk-users-and-where-to-find-them>, studies the question of high-risk users in greater detail).

Discussion on my experience with phishing training: most everyone uses embedded training and "report phishing" button (but not always). Feedback is uncommon. At its worst, is a game played by cybersecurity team to see how many people they can fool, using email templates with substantial inside knowledge (and not a realistic example of what they are likely to receive). At best, it uses realistic examples, periodic training, and provides feedback, with the goal of 0% click rate.
