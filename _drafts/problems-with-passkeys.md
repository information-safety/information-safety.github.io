Let's talk about Passkeys.

Problems:

- Server-side: websites not implementing passkeys in a way that provides full phishing resistance (US Bank vs HSA)
- Client-side: Google, Apple, MS, and password manager vendor lock-in, problems with passkey UI
- Recovery: what happens when you lose your passkey? Bad guys shift to attacking the recovery process
- Social: implementing passkeys is optional

It's a real engineering problem that requires a multidisciplinary approach; engineers, security, and designers (UI/UX)

Solutions?
