Earlier this month I joined Dustin Lehr on the [Security Champions Podcast](https://www.securityjourney.com/resources/security-champions-podcast)! I enjoyed our conversation, which covered adapting ideas from safety to security, empowering developers, influence, organizational change management, and more. It even included an old phrase I coined, that particularly resonated with Dustin:

> "A security amateur knows how to secure things; a security professional knows when you don't have to."

Dustin has a full [writeup](https://www.securityjourney.com/post/tapping-other-fields-to-approach-security-differently) on the Security Journey blog, and you can watch a video version of the podcast on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wKdyXnSL9E) or listen to it on your favorite podcast app!

## Description

John joins the podcast to explore what it means to treat security like other mature safety disciplines. Drawing on safety science, economics, and hands-on AppSec experience, he shares a practical perspective on security as decision support and how empowering developers with the right time and tools leads to stronger security outcomes.
