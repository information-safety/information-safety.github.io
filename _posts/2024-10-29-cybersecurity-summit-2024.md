Today I spoke at the 14th annual [Cyber Security Summit](http://cybersecuritysummit.org)! My talk, *Security Differently*, was a slightly shorter version of the one I gave at [Secure 360]({% post_url 2024-05-15-secure360-2024 %}).

I enjoyed presenting in the main ballroom, and got positive feedback from attendees afterwards - I only wish I had more time to answer questions!

## Session Description

Cybersecurity, especially traditional security, has stagnated; adding security controls has appreciably improved outcomes and we continue to struggle with basic problems like vulnerabilities. Safety faced a similar problem 10-15 years ago; scientists and practitioners saw that safety outcomes were stagnant and concluded that the traditional method of avoiding accidents through centralized policies, procedures, and controls was no longer driving improvements.

I believe we're seeing the same thing in security: historically, we've focused on constraining worker behavior to prevent cybersecurity breaches, and the limits of that approach are becoming increasingly clear. Adapting concepts from Safety Differently and Safety II offers a solution, by supporting success and focusing on positive capacities. In this talk, I will present practical advice on how to create a security program based on modern safety principles using evidence from both security and safety, and how it changes the role of the security professional.
