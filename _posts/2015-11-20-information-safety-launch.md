Three years in the making, `information-safety.org` is finally launching. As I have studied and learned more about safety, I've become increasingly convinced that the Information Security world can benefit from safety risk management methods. I've started this site to both share what I'm learning and to invite others to join in the search.

We're hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/information-safety), to encourage collaboration and continuous development. You can currently read more [about](/about/) information safety, peruse a collection of [resources](/resources/) on safety risk management,  [contribute](/contribute/) directly to the website, or join the [LinkedIn group](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/8431965/).
