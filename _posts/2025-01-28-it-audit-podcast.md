Back in September, I was a guest on the IT Audit Labs [Podcast](https://www.itauditlabs.com/the-audit)!

I enjoyed my time talking with Joshua, Nick, and Eric about safety science and how we can apply lessons from safety to security. We covered a number of topics, including risk, ergonomics, culture, CrowdStrike and aviation, and I was pleasantly surprised to learn that Eric is a pilot!

You can find the episode on your favorite podcast service, or watch a video of the session on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAQFiH78roQ).
