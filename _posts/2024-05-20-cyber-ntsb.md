As I work through cataloging presentations I've done this week, I've come across a few that I haven't yet posted here (or on <https://transvasive.com>). I'll be posting them here over the next three days.

One of the "missing" talks was a short slide deck I put together as part of a "Papers We Love" discussion on *Learning from Cyber Incidents: Adapting Aviation Safety Models to Cybersecurity*, a [paper](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/learning-cyber-incidents-adapting-aviation-safety-models-cybersecurity) published by a working group organized by Harvard's Belfer Center to explore the concept of creating a "Cyber NTSB".

I came across this paper having met one of the lead authors, Adam Shostack. Adam especially has been interested in creating a "Cyber NTSB", an idea we share, although I likely take a broader interest in adapting safety to cybersecurity.

The paper is well written and the workshop seemed well thought out, as it included presentations from people actually working at the NTSB, grounding the discussion in work-as-done instead of work-as-imagined at the NTSB. It also included a session led by the psychologist and safety scientist David Woods on cross-domain learning; as I discovered in my studies, safety doesn't translate directly (for example between aviation and marine safety). The findings are sound and follow current safety science thinking and are included in the slides.

For me, the practical takeaways were and remain:

- A recurring theme is discussion of blame, and how NTSB specifically avoids assigning liability in accident investigations, as avoiding blame improves learning
- There are domain-specific challenges unique to Security; donâ€™t blindly copy what works in aviation safety
- Near Miss reporting is an important complement to incident investigation; share stories of the close calls
