*Secure360 Update:* I've been asked by a couple of people to share a version of my slides that better shows how my [talk](https://web.archive.org/web/20210806005515/https://secure360.org/session/john-benninghoff-chaos-resilience-engineering-my-journey/?conference=11809&date=20200505) presented the ideas in my [references post]({% post_url 2020-05-01-chaos-resilience-secure360 %}).

To answer that request, I've posted a low-res version of the slides with some of my talk notes [here](/assets/secure360-chaos-resilience-notes.pdf).

These notes will probably make more sense if you've seen the talk, which was recorded for conference attendees (but not currently publicly available).

**Update:** Since Secure360 was fully virtual due to COVID in 2020, a video of the talk is available [here](https://vimeo.com/415273694), and for some reason, also [here](https://vimeo.com/417292334).
