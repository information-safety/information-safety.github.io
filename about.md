Information Safety is my personal blog focusing on adapting safety science to technology and cybersecurity. You can find my older work at [transvasive.com](https://transvasive.com). I started [Security Differently](https://www.security-differently.com) to help organizations implement security using these principles.

## What is Information Safety?

*Information Safety* is a reliability (or *resilience*) practice that uses methods originally developed for safety. Safety methods are being successfully applied to build and operate resilient software systems - systems that fail less often and recover from failure faster.

## Presentation

["Organizing Risk Management Programs, or, What I Learned from the Secret Service and the Aviation Industry"](https://vimeo.com/44519848) (video) - a talk given by [@jabenninghoff](https://github.com/jabenninghoff) at [SIRAcon 2012](https://vimeo.com/societyinforisk) comparing *protection* and *safety* approaches to risk management that introduced the idea of "information safety."

## Security Differently

[Security Differently]({% post_url 2023-10-31-security-differently %}) adapts concepts from [Safety Differently](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Safety_Differently/KGDiEAAAQBAJ?hl=en) and [Safety-II](https://www.england.nhs.uk/signuptosafety/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2015/10/safety-1-safety-2-whte-papr.pdf) to Cybersecurity.
